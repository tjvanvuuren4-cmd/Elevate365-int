              <p>
                Founded in 2020 by a team of cyber security and blockchain experts, Elevate Academy was born from a simple observation: there was a massive skills gap in two of the most important technology sectors of our time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our founders, having worked at leading tech companies and witnessed first-hand the shortage of qualified professionals, decided to create a platform that would provide practical, industry-relevant education to anyone willing to learn.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, we’re proud to have trained over 19,000 students worldwide, with many going on to secure positions at top companies or start their own successful ventures in cyber security and blockchain.
